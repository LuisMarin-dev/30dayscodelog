- Today I started this log to document the last few steps of my pre-job programming journey. A few days ago I started the Fleur Clothing repository. 
  Fleur Clothing is a Clothing Store porject that uses the following technologies:
  * The basics (HTML, CSS, Javascript)
  * SASS (css library)
  * React
  * Redux (for state management)
  * Typescript
  * Firebase (NoSQL cloud database)
  * GraphQL (API querying)
  * Stripe (Payment processing)
